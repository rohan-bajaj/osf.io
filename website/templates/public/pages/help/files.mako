    <h4 class="m-t-lg f-w-lg">Files</h4>
    <p>Each project and component can have its own set of files. This allows you to organize your files into meaningful
        groups like datasets or background research.</p>
    <p>Each file is given a unique URL, meaning that it can be cited or linked to individually.</p>
    <p>To upload a file, click on "Files" in the grey navigation bar under the Project/Component's title. Here you
        can drag the file from your desktop on to the screen to upload, or click on the upload button that appears after you've selected a storage add-on in the files pane. To download a file from a project, select the file and then click the Download button that appears in the toolbar; likewise, to delete a file, 
        select the file and then click the Delete button. You can create folders to organize files by selecting the storage add-on in which you'd like to create a folder and clicking the Create Folder button in the toolbar.</p>
    <p>Only contributors of that component with writing privileges can add or delete a file. If a component is set to
        be private, then no one will be able to see the enclosed files, but public components and projects allow
        anyone to download their materials.</p>
