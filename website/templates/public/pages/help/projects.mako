    <p>Projects are the largest form of categorization that the OSF supports. A project could be an experiment,
        a lab group, or a paper&mdash;anything that has contributing members and files or explanatory texts/images.</p>
    <p>When you click on a project to open it, you are taken to the Project Overview page. This page provides access
        to the features of the project via a gray navigation bar, as well as an overview of the components, files, tags,
        history, and wiki associated with the project.</p>
