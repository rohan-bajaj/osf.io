    <h4 class="m-t-lg f-w-lg">Collaborative Wiki</h4>
    <p>The wiki is a versatile tool for interacting with your team or the people who view your work. Each project
   and component has a wiki and you can add more pages if you wish. For example, you might have a wiki page explaining
    the main points of your project, but also have a wiki page with lab notes, with contact information, or with
    more indepth detail on one aspect of your project. You can also turn the wiki off completely in the
    "Select Add-Ons" section of your project settings.</p>

    <p>The wiki supports collaborative editing. Your entire team can get online and write at the same time together.
    Furthermore, the wiki supports versioning, meaning that every time you hit save, the OSF will store a new copy of
    the wiki. You can always go back to previous versions of your wiki, and you compare your current wiki with
    previous iterations.</p>
    <p>Here are two resources that you might find helpful for formatting your wiki with markdown and TeX:</p>
