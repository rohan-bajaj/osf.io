    <p>All projects are private by default. However, you can choose to make your project's contents available for
        anyone to view. Once you make a project public, you can gain more feedback about the impact of your work by
        tracking how many people are visiting your project and downloading or forking your research materials.</p>
    <p>Components you have added can have their own privacy settings. Making the project public does not make all
        of its components public. For example, you can make your methodology component public, but leave the data
        in a private component.</p>
